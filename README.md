# IMDB_data_analysis

This movies dataset includes 3.5K+ movies of varied genres. Dataset contains the movies' details like IMDB rating, cast, profit and more. I created a Tableau Dashboard to analyze a dataset of over 3,500 movies. The objective was to provide insightful answers to specific questions posed by our client, a movie production house.

**1: Profit Collected by Each Genre Since 2000
**
To determine the profit collected by each genre since 2000, I created a bar chart that aggregates the total profit for each genre over the specified period. This visualization allows us to quickly identify the most and least profitable genres.

**2: Top 10 Countries with Highest Number of Movie Releases Post-2006
**
For this question, I utilized a map visualization to highlight the top 10 countries with the highest number of movie releases since 2006. By using a map, we can visually represent the data and easily compare the number of releases across different countries.

**3: Correlation Between Director, Gross Earned, and IMDB Rating
**
This question required a more complex analysis. I created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between gross earnings and IMDB ratings for different directors. To add more depth, I included a trend line to show the correlation. Additionally, I created a ranking system to identify the top and bottom 5 movies based on their correlation, which are highlighted in the scatter plot. This approach helps us understand which directors tend to produce higher-grossing and higher-rated movies.

**4a: Percentage of Movies Contributed by USA, UK, Australia, France, and Rest of the World
**
I used a pie chart to depict the percentage contribution of movies by these countries to the industry. This visualization provides a clear and immediate understanding of the market share of each country.

**4b: Percentage of Movies Contributed by Genres Each Year
**
For this analysis, I created a stacked bar chart that shows the percentage contribution of different genres like action, comedy, thriller, drama, history, and war each year. This helps in identifying trends in genre popularity over time.

**Final Dashboard
**
To bring all these analyses together, I created a comprehensive dashboard that combines all the visualizations. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, allowing the client to interact with the data through filters and parameters. This interactivity enables them to explore the data further based on their specific interests.
